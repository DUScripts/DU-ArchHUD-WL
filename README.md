# Wolfe Labs AR Mod for ArchHUD

This project is a mod created for [ArchHUD](https://github.com/Archaegeo/Archaegeo-Orbital-Hud) which aims to add Augmented Reality markers into the HUD, along with a "lite" mode, aiming for better FPS.

**Note:** This only supports the modular build of ArchHUD, not the GFN one.

## Installation

Add the `userclass.lua` file to your ArchHUD install directory (usually autoconf/custom/archhud) and you're done, any Control Unit with ArchHUD installed will now have AR enabled by default.

You can switch into "lite" mode by pressing Alt + 3. You will be presented with a minimal UI instead of the default HUD. You can always switch back by pressing Alt + 3 again.
